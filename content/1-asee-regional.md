This last weekend, I went to the ASEE north central region conference at
Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Michigan. I had the opportunity to hear
from a variety of different speakers.

One speaker from Michigan State University gave a presentation on a model for
UML diagrams for blind programmers, which I found very interesting. Some of the problems
detailed were the difficulties in how useful diagrams are visually, but not
with feel or audio.
