Today I bought [http://chriswallace.io](http://chriswallace.io). Currently, it
is pointing to the same place as notoriouscw but I would like to move
everything over in due time.

In the coming weeks, I should be able to get my email working at this new
address. However, I really would like to run my own mailserver so this may
present challenges... more to come here.
