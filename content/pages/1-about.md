Title: About Me

Hello! My name is Chris Wallace, and I am currently in my third year at The
Ohio State University. I grew up in a small Ohio town, came to a big
university, and I have been finding my own way ever since.

#### why computer science?
I am driven by the fact that, with computer science, we have the ability to
make anything possible. This drives me to learn more and more about this field,
and what really attracts me to computing.

#### what else do you do?
Well, [I like cars](/files/static-site-images/240d.jpg), and I particularly
enjoy FIA Formula 1. Also, I enjoy tinkering with things, riding motorcycles,
and seeing my family.
