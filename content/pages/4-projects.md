#### ges tracking
The Engineering Scholars program has requirements, such as community service
hours and event attendance. Previously, however, people were using a google
survey to enter in their information, receiving only a confirmation email.

Seeing this as an issue, I created a simple logging page to teach myself
Django. This application stores student involvement in a database which
can be retrieved and emailed to the user.

#### simplER
For the cardinal health codefest, our team built **simplr**, a basic emergency
room management tool. We won "most impactful".

#### the osc librarian
A ruby/rails application for managing physical assets of the Open Source Club.
Since these mainly consist of books, we made it easy to add books with just
scanning in an ISBN. Eventually, this will be deployed on a raspberry pi.

School of Architecture. Mainly geared toward places with student employees.
