Title: Technical Skills

#### languages
Proficiently, I know the following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby,
Javascript, bash, MATLAB, and LaTeX. 
I have some kind of experience or exposure to the following languages:
Common LISP, scheme, perl, and php, css

#### software development
I have had experience with the agile software development methodology. Also,
I understand and use (sometimes daily) and number of tools to make my life
easier. These include distributed version control systems (git, hg, bzr),
*modern* text editors like vim, a variety of unix tools like grep/sed, and
finally a suite of debuggers (primarily gdb).

#### web development
At IBM, I worked for a significant amount of time writing Javascript with Dojo,
giving me a solid base of experience with AJAX and REST calls. Through
hackathons and personal projects, I have learned MVC web development using
frameworks like python/django and ruby/rails. Additionally through these
projects I have learned css and sass/scss to a degree.

#### system administration
I have reasonably extensive experience managing Windows systems with Active
Directory, and *nix systems with mit-kerberos and LDAP. Additional exposure to
KVM, xen, LXC, docker, and other fun tools has given me a solid foundation for
virtualization, and scripting has helped me automate repetitive tasks.

Additionally, I have configured a mail server, multiple web servers (apache,
nginx), firewalls with iptables, and more.
