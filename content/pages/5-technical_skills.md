Title: Technical Skills

#### languages
Proficiently, I know the following languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby,
Javascript, bash, MATLAB, and LaTeX. 
I have some kind of experience or exposure to the following languages:
Common LISP, scheme, perl, and php

#### software development
I have had experience with the agile software development methodology. Also,
understand and use (sometimes daily) and number of tools to make my life
easier. These include distributed version control systems (git, hg, bzr),
*modern* text editors like vim, a variety of unix tools like grep/sed, and
finally a suite of debuggers (primarily gdb).

#### web development
Through hackathons and personal projects, I have learned MVC web development
using frameworks like python/django and ruby/rails.

#### system administration
I have reasonably extensive experience managing Windows systems with Active
Directory, and *nix systems with mit-kerberos and LDAP. Additional exposure to
KVM, xen, LXC, docker, and other fun tools has given me a solid foundation for
virtualization, and scripting has helped me automate repetitive tasks.

Additionally, I have configured a mail server, multiple web servers (apache,
nginx), firewalls with iptables, and more.
